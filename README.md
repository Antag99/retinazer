Retinazer is an implementation of the [entity-component-system][ecs] design
pattern in Java. Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/antag99/retinazer/wiki)
for documentation.

## What is this?
Retinazer is an implementation of the [entity-component-system][ecs] design
pattern. Currently, no release is available, as it's still in heavy development.
But I expect to be able to release an initial development version pretty soon.

## Great! I'd like to help!
Contributions are welcome, but make sure to follow the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
Also, if you plan to implement a new major feature, please open an issue first
so I can provide input.
