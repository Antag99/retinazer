# Retinazer

Retinazer is an ECS framework for Java. It is based on [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley) 1.6.0,
with changes to the API, internal workings as well as performance enhancements such as representing entities with integer indices.
It is not actively maintained, I would recommend usage of [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley) or [artemis-odb](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb) instead.

On the experimental branch, a bytecode weaver/struct emulation implementation may be found.
